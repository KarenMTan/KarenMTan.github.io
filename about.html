            I'm currently a student at UCLA. I'm pursuing a BS in Computer Science and plan to graduate in 2022.

            To me, computer science is a beautiful tool used to facilitate. To expedite. To automate.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've grown up in an age where a phone app warns me of traffic conditions on the way home. An age where I can talk to a friend continents away in under a second. An age where thousands of emails can be sorted with a click of a button.
        </p>
        <p>
            This summer, I had the opportunity to design and develop some of my own such applications. As a co-op at <a href="experience.html#bendix">Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems' Research and Development Center in Irvine, California</a>, I applied Python's Tkinter and pySerial libraries to create an in-house tool that helps engineers experiment with hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register">camera registers</a> simultaneously.

        </p>
        <p>
            During the development process, I found significant support online. Regardless of the many "how to...with tkinter" entered or countless error messages pasted into search bars - someone had already asked. And remarkably - someone else had answered it. It reinforced my admiration and appreciation for the open community. It's one of the reasons I love this field: there are millions of people eager to learn and a million others excited to teach.

            <!-- I also helped design and evaluate the SafetyDirect mobile app which will allow thousands of drivers to record trips in their commercial vehicles. The mobile app also gives hundreds of fleet-managers and individual drivers access to video recordings and event data.  -->
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, this community inspired me to join SWE@UCLA's Technical Committee where I organized and directed the 7-week <a href="tutorials.html">Build Your Own Website Portfolio Workshop Series</a> to teach and encourage web development to students of all majors.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm always excited to work on new projects! Reach out to me at karenmtan@g.ucla.edu
