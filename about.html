                I'm a second year Computer Science major at UCLA.

                <!-- I love computer science because  -->

                Last year, I was a member of SWE@UCLA's Technical Committee where I directed and instructed workshops like the seven-week Build Your Own Website Portfolio Workshop Series. My goal was provide guidance and mentorship to encourage students of all majors to explore web development.

                This summer, I'm interning at Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems in Irvine, California. Over these past few weeks, I've adapted Python's Tkinter and PySerial libraries to design and develop an in-house tool to help engineers experiment with camera image sensors. I've also helped design and evaluate the SafetyDirect mobile app which will allow thousands of drivers to record trips in their commercial vehicles.

            <p>I'm from Diamond Bar, California. I'm a second year Computer Science major at the University of California, Los Angeles. I attended Diamond Bar High School and graduated in 2018. </p>

            <p>One of my largest influences and fondest memories is being part of FRC Team 3473, "Team Sprocket". From 2016 to 2017, I was one of 8 programmers on the Programming Subteam. There I learned Java and thus was the start of my journey into the world of Computer Science. From 2017 to 2018, I served as Engineering Captain of over 50 members. That season, Team Sprocket won the Orange County Regional and qualified for the World Championships in Houston, Texas.</p>
