                During the summer of 2016, twenty-some high schoolers and I met up every Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 5 pm. It was the summer I learned about <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectNumber.html" target="_blank">perfect numbers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation" target="_blank">remainder division</a> and <a href="http://developeronline.blogspot.com/2008/04/why-array-index-should-start-from-0.html" target="_blank">how to count from 0</a>. It was my first year on the <a href="https://www.team3473.com/" target="_blank">high school robotics team</a>.
            </p> 

            <p>
                And it quickly spiraled into an obsession. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In the middle of Build Season, we would meet twenty, sometimes thirty hours a week. But we were fueled by a passion that made us blind to fatigue and deaf to disbelief. It cultivated in all of us a dream to forge a regional-winning robot out of zip ties and cannibalized robot parts.
            </p>        
                    
            <p>
                And that season, for the first time since the conception of the team, we qualified for and competed at the World Championships in Houston.
            </p>
                   
            <p>
                The two years I spent on the team imbued in me an addiction to ambition and a craving for challenge. They inspired me to pursue a career in engineering and computer science.
            </p>        
                
            <p>
                And since my first introduction, I’ve learned that computer science is much more than programming. This summer, I’m interning at <a href="https://www.bendix.com/en/" target="_blank">Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems</a> where I’ve had the opportunity to explore several applications of computer science. I’ve poured hours into designing and developing an in-house tool to help engineers rapidly experiment with camera image sensors. I’ve spent days armed with dry-erase markers, outlining the skeleton of the SafetyDirect mobile app. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These experiences have ignited a passion for design and engineering. They’ve carved a vision to one day invent tools that will impact the world. And just like that dream years ago, I know this passion will surmount any obstacle that dare stand between me and my vision.
